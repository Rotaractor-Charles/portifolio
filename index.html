											<p>
												I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2017. Since then, I’ve worked as a freelancer on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, helping clients conduct research across various fields.
											</p>
											<p>
												Along the way, something shifted — I felt a strong pull toward building things, and that’s when I dove into web development. I joined the 100Devs agency, where I honed my skills in designing and developing websites and web applications.
											</p>
											<p>
												Driven by this passion, I’ve been building responsive, user-focused digital experiences that solve real problems and help businesses grow.
